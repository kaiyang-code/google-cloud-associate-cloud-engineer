# Notes

## Cloud Computing and GCP Fundamentals

- **private cloud:** private cloud = on-premise cloud
  - private cloud follows the 5 characteristics of cloud
- **on-premise data center:** a group of servers that you privately own and control
  - private data center does not follow the 5 characteristics of cloud

- **Network File System (NFS):** a distributed file system protocol for shared storage. The NFS shared storage protocol defines the way files are stored and retrieved from storage devices across networks. It is one of several network-attached storage (NAS) distributed file system standards

- **billing account:** used to track the usage and costs of GCP services, and to receive invoices or make payments for those services
- **payment profile:** a representation of a payment method used to pay for GCP services
- **billing account vs payment profile:** A billing account can have one payment profile associated with it, and a payment profile can be associated with one billing account at a time
- **workspace:** A workspace usually represents the root folder of your project and includes your project-specific configuration files
  - a workspace is a container for organizing and managing related resources, such as projects, folders, and billing accounts
  - workspaces are used to group resources together based on criteria such as business unit, department, or environment (e.g., development, testing, production)
  - with workspaces, you can specify persistent settings, run and debug configurations, and UI states (like open files) for all the folders in your workspace
